<pre>
total: the total amount of money deposited in your account
specifiedMoney:the amount of money you want to specify to this position
(e.g. if you have 300$ in total and you want to open 2 positions, you may want to specify a maximum of 150$ to each of them)
risk: risk(percentage)
reward: reward(percentage)
leverage: position's leverage
fraction: the fraction of your total money that you're willing to risk
(e.g. if you have 1000$ and you put 7 as your fraction input, if your position hit an stoploss, you'll lose 1000/7=142.85$ in that position)
